A Dockerfile is essentially a **blueprint** or a **recipe** written in a specific, human-readable format that Docker uses to automatically build Docker images. 

*Key Characteristics:**

* **Text File:** It's a plain text file, typically named just `Dockerfile` (without any extension).
* **Specific Format:** It follows a defined syntax consisting of **instructions** and their corresponding **arguments**.
* **Instruction-Argument Format:**
    * **INSTRUCTION (Uppercase):** These are keywords that tell Docker what action to perform. Examples you mentioned (`RUN`, `COPY`, `ENTRYPOINT`) are common ones.
    * **argument (Lowercase or mixed case):** This provides the details or parameters for the instruction. For example, with `RUN apt-get update`, `apt-get update` is the argument.
* **Sequential Execution:** Docker reads and executes the instructions in the Dockerfile sequentially, from top to bottom. Each instruction creates a new "layer" in the Docker image.

**Dissecting Your Example:**

Let's break down the example you provided:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y some-package
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "my_script.py"]
```

* **`FROM ubuntu`**:
    * **Instruction:** `FROM`
    * **Argument:** `ubuntu`
    * **Meaning:** This is always the **first non-comment line** in a Dockerfile. It specifies the **base image** upon which your new image will be built. In this case, it tells Docker to start with the official `ubuntu` image from Docker Hub. You are correct that every Docker image builds upon another existing image.
* **`RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y some-package`**:
    * **Instruction:** `RUN`
    * **Argument:** `apt-get update && apt-get install -y some-package`
    * **Meaning:** The `RUN` instruction executes commands within the container being built. Here, it first updates the package lists (`apt-get update`) and then installs a package named `some-package` without prompting for confirmation (`-y`). This modifies the base `ubuntu` image by adding this software.
* **`COPY . /app`**:
    * **Instruction:** `COPY`
    * **Argument:** `. /app`
    * **Meaning:** The `COPY` instruction copies files and directories from the **host machine** (where the Dockerfile is located) to the specified **destination** inside the image. In this case, it copies everything in the current directory (`.`) on your machine to the `/app` directory within the image.
* **`WORKDIR /app`**:
    * **Instruction:** `WORKDIR`
    * **Argument:** `/app`
    * **Meaning:** The `WORKDIR` instruction sets the **working directory** for any subsequent `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, or `ADD` instructions. So, after this line, any commands will be executed within the `/app` directory inside the container.
* **`ENTRYPOINT ["python", "my_script.py"]`**:
    * **Instruction:** `ENTRYPOINT`
    * **Argument:** `["python", "my_script.py"]`
    * **Meaning:** The `ENTRYPOINT` instruction specifies the executable that will be run when a container is started from this image. Here, it's configured to execute the `python` interpreter with the `my_script.py` file as its argument. This defines the main process of the container.
