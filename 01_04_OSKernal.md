### **Kernel & Running Linux Containers on Windows**

### **Understanding Kernel & Docker on Windows**  

1. **What is a Kernel?**  
   - The **kernel** is the core part of an operating system that interacts with hardware and manages resources (CPU, memory, etc.).  
   - Different OSes have different kernels (e.g., **Linux kernel** vs. **Windows NT kernel**).  

2. **Why Can't Linux Containers Run Natively on Windows?**  
   - Docker **shares** the host OS kernel.  
   - A **Linux container** expects a **Linux kernel**, while a **Windows container** needs the **Windows NT kernel**.  
   - Since Windows and Linux use different kernels, they **aren't natively compatible**.  

3. **How Does Docker Run Linux Containers on Windows?**  
   - Docker uses a **Linux Virtual Machine (VM)** inside Windows (via **WSL2** or **Hyper-V**) to provide a **Linux kernel**.  
   - When you run a Linux container on Windows, itâ€™s actually running **inside a hidden Linux VM**, not directly on Windows.  

4. **Key Takeaway**  
   - **Linux containers require a Linux kernel.**  
   - **Windows Docker installs a lightweight Linux VM** in the background to support them.  
   - **Windows containers** can run natively on Windows, but **Linux containers need WSL2/Hyper-V.**
   - Containers share the same OS kernel, making them lightweight and faster to start compared to Virtual Machines (VMs).
  
5. **Containers vs. Virtual Machines**  
   - **Containers** share the host OS kernel, making them **lightweight (MB-sized)** and **faster** (seconds to start).  
   - **Virtual Machines** run full OS instances, making them **heavier (GB-sized)** and **slower** (minutes to start).  
   - **Containers have less isolation** than VMs but are more efficient for application deployment.
