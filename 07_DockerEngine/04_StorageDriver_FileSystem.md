## üìÅ Default Docker File System Location

When Docker is installed, it uses the default directory (in linux):

```
/var/lib/docker
```

This directory includes several subdirectories, each responsible for storing different components like images, containers, and volumes.

### üóÇ Example Directory Structure

```bash
ls /var/lib/docker
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5117cac-f69c-42fd-88b0-53bbf1034bf4)

* `aufs/`: Stores the layers for images and containers.
* `containers/`: Stores metadata and logs for each container.
* `image/`: Stores metadata for images.
* `network/`, `plugins/`, etc.: Other Docker internals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Storage Driver: AUFS

Docker uses a **storage driver** to manage image and container layers. To check which driver is in use:

```bash
# Display a summary of Docker disk usage
docker system df | more
```

**Sample Output Snippet:**

> üîπ **AUFS** (Advanced Multi-Layered Unification Filesystem) is the default driver on **Ubuntu/Debian** systems.

## üìÇ AUFS Structure Explained

AUFS uses three main subfolders under `/var/lib/docker/aufs`:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e851f3d8-6b8e-4636-bc4f-4b901366f051)

| Folder    | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `diff/`   | Actual content of each image layer.     |
| `layers/` | Metadata about how layers are stacked.  |
| `mnt/`    | Mount points for container filesystems. |

## üê≥ Pulling a Sample Image

Let's pull the official **hello-world** image:

```bash
docker pull hello-world
```

To confirm:

```bash
docker images
```
Check AUFS `diff/`:

```bash
ls /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bcb256b-0a3a-4940-911c-c093b1b82043)

---

## üß† View Image Build History

Use the `docker history` command to trace how an image was built:

```bash
docker history hello-world
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2719b13-d833-4e1f-96bb-ca7c6b34342b)

This reveals:

* `COPY` step (adding the hello script)
* `CMD` step (running the script)
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Manually Run a Script from a Layer (Advanced/Hack)

Navigate to the AUFS diff folder and manually run the script stored in the image layer (not generally recommended):

```bash
cd /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/<layer_id>
./hello
```

## üß™ Building a Custom Docker Image (Flask App)

### Sample Flask App Structure

```bash
app.py
Dockerfile
```

### Dockerfile Example

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ddfa3dc-526e-44e6-b3b5-b815c446c858)

### Build the Image

```bash
docker build -t simple-web-app .
```

üïí **First-time build** may take several minutes (downloads base images, installs dependencies).

## üß∞ Docker Caching

Rebuild the same image:

```bash
docker build -t simple-web-app .
```

You‚Äôll see messages like Using cache for each step, meaning Docker is reusing previously built layers. Since dependencies were already built earlier, the rebuild completes in about 1 second ‚Äî it's fast because no new changes require a full rebuild.

**Docker caches image layers**, so it skips unchanged steps during rebuild.

---

## üïµÔ∏è View Image History

```bash
docker history simple-web-app
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0d0347e-3f47-4752-a541-16850b5b8825)

## üìä Checking AUFS Layer Sizes

```bash
du -sh /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/*
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c53d13b-80f5-44ce-9e2a-b5b3900f60d1)

Match large folders (e.g., 376MB) to corresponding layers (e.g., Flask dependencies).

Locate your app code:

* Look for the smallest folders (e.g., 12K)
* `ls` or `cat` to view the actual Python file
---
Find and view the content of app.py file.

---

## üîÅ Rebuilding with Modified Code

Make a **minor change** in `app.py`.

Create a new Dockerfile if filename changed (e.g., `Dockerfile2`):

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN pip3 install flask
COPY app2.py /opt/app2.py
ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "/opt/app2.py"]
```

Build with the custom Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile2 -t simple-web-app-2 .
```

üöÄ Output will show first few layers **using cache**, while last steps (COPY, ENTRYPOINT) are rebuilt.

### üßä Docker Images and Size Explained

After building our Docker images,  even though the **second image** (with just a tiny change in application code) shared **most layers with the first**, both images were reported as **467 MB** using `docker images`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/823d7df6-04fc-44ca-9942-1cb7c876946a)

#### üßæ Why Same Size Despite Small Changes?

Let‚Äôs break this down:

* Docker uses a **layered architecture**, where each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer.
* When you make a change (like modifying your app source code), Docker only rebuilds **from the changed instruction onward** ‚Äî earlier layers are reused from **cache**.
* However, the size shown in `docker images` is **not just the size of the unique layers** in that image. It includes the **cumulative size of all layers** that the image references, even if they are **shared with other images**.

> ‚úÖ **Important Note:**
> The `docker images` output shows the **total size** of an image as if it were to be exported independently ‚Äî including shared base layers like Ubuntu. The size shown is not the actual space used on disk by that specific image ‚Äî it's the virtual size, including shared layers that may already be cached.

To find out how much space each image actually consumes on disk including shared size, use: 
```
docker system df -v
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f53ef48c-fbc3-43a1-8380-3c7d9bb2e04e)

#### üìå Key Points to Remember

* **Layer Sharing:** Layers are shared across images to save disk space **internally**, but each image reports the full size of its own layer stack.
* **Cache Efficiency:** Docker builds are fast when reusing cached layers. But once a single instruction changes, **all subsequent steps** must be rebuilt.
* **Output of `docker images`:** Shows:

  * **REPOSITORY** ‚Äì name (e.g., `simple-web-app`)
  * **TAG** ‚Äì version label (e.g., `latest`)
  * **IMAGE ID** ‚Äì unique identifier
  * **CREATED** ‚Äì when it was built
  * **SIZE** ‚Äì **total virtual size** (sum of all layers in the image)

## üìå Important Notes

1. **Docker Layer Caching Works Top-Down:**

   * If step 4 changes, all steps **after** it are rebuilt.
   * Only **unchanged instructions from the top** are cached.

2. **Image Size Consistency:**

   * Even if only 1KB of code changes, Docker still shows total image size (including base layers).

3. **AUFS Folder Contents:**

   * All actual file contents are in `/var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/`
   * You can inspect file sizes using `du -sh`
   * Each folder is a **layer**, and the contents map to instructions in Dockerfile.

4. **Avoid manual tampering** in `/var/lib/docker` ‚Äî it‚Äôs for internal use.

## üß† Tips to Remember

* Docker **stores all its data in `/var/lib/docker`**.
* AUFS is a **layered filesystem**, each Dockerfile instruction = one layer.
* Layers are reused during builds using Docker's **build cache**.
* Storage drivers like AUFS control **how Docker manages file contents** on disk.

---------------

In a windows default installation, layers are stored in C:\ProgramData\dockerdesktop and split across the "image" and "windowsfilter" directories. You can change where the layers are stored using the docker-root configuration, as demonstrated in the Docker Engine on Windows documentation.
