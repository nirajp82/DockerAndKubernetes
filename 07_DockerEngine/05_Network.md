# Docker Networking Explained

Docker is a containerization platform that uses OS-level virtualization to package software applications and their dependencies into reusable units called **containers**. Docker containers can be run on any host with Docker or an equivalent container runtime installed, whether locally on your laptop or in a remote cloud.

Docker includes a **networking system** for managing communications between containers, your Docker host, and the outside world. Several different network types are supported, facilitating a variety of common use cases.

In this article, we’ll explain how Docker networks function, then cover the basics of using them with your container deployments.

## 🧠 Docker Network Types

Docker networks configure communications between neighboring containers and external services. Containers must be connected to a Docker network to receive any network connectivity. The communication routes available to the container depend on the network connections it has.

Docker comes with **five built-in network drivers** that implement core networking functionality:

* `bridge`
* `host`
* `None`
* `overlay`
* `ipvlan`
* `macvlan`

### 1. **Bridge** (Default for containers)

* This is the **default network** Docker uses when you don't specify one.
* It's a **private internal network** created on the Docker host.
* Containers in this network get internal IP addresses in the **172.17.x.x** range.
* Containers connected to the bridge can talk to each other. These containers can communicate with each other using these IP addresses.
* To allow external access, **map ports** from the container to the Docker host.
  > Example: `docker run -p 8080:80 my-web-app` maps container's port 80 to host's port 8080.
* Containers are isolated from the host and other networks unless specifically configured.
* Each container gets its own IP.
* They **can access your LAN and the internet**, but **won’t appear as physical devices** on your LAN.
Here's a diagram showing how the default **Docker bridge network** connects containers to each other, the **host**, and the **internet**:

### 🖼️ Docker Bridge Network Diagram

### 🔍 Key Components

* **docker0**: The bridge interface on the host (`172.17.0.1` by default).
* **Containers**: Get IPs from the bridge subnet and can communicate with each other.
* **NAT (iptables)**: Docker sets up NAT rules so containers can access the **internet via host**.
* **Host ↔ Container communication**: Possible via the `docker0` interface.
* **Inbound from Internet**: Only works if ports are published (`-p 8080:80`), else containers are isolated.
---
### 2. `host`

### 🧠 What is Docker's *Host Network*?

When a container uses the **host network**, it doesn't get its own virtual network or IP. Instead, it shares the same network as your computer (the **host**). It's like the container is running **directly on your machine's network**.

### 🧩 Key Points (in simple terms):

* 🚫 **No separate network**: The container **does not get its own IP address**.
* 🔗 **Shares the host’s ports**: If your container listens on port `80`, it actually uses your **host's port 80**.
* 🔒 **No isolation**: There’s **no network isolation** between the container and your host.
* ⚠️ **Only one container** can use a specific port at a time (since they share the host’s ports).

### 🧪 Example

If you run:

```bash
docker run --network host nginx
```

Then visiting `http://localhost` on your machine will directly connect to **nginx** inside the container — because it’s using your host’s port 80.

### ⚙️ When to Use It?

* When you need **fast network performance**.
* When your app **requires access to the host’s network interfaces** (e.g., for low-level networking, service discovery, or multicast).
* Use with **care** — you lose the security isolation of container networking.

### 3. `None`
In Docker, the `None` network mode is a special configuration that isolates a container from all network communication. When a container is connected to a network with the `None` mode, it does **not** have any access to:

1. **External Networks**: The container cannot communicate with the outside world, including the internet, or other hosts on the local network.

2. **Other Containers**: It also cannot communicate with other containers on the same host, even if those containers are connected to the default bridge network or any other custom networks.

### How `None` Network Mode Works

* **Network Stack Disabled**: The container has no networking capabilities. This means that no interfaces (e.g., `eth0`) are created, and no IP addresses are assigned.
* **Use Cases**: This can be useful when you need a container that performs specific tasks, like running a process that doesn't need network communication, or if you're running a container with a security focus that should be fully isolated from network traffic.

### Example of Using `None` Network Mode
Sure! Here's a real-world example:

### Real-World Example: Database Backup Container

Imagine you're running a **database backup** task inside a Docker container, and you don't want it to communicate with any other container or external network. This task involves taking a snapshot of the database or writing backup files to the local filesystem. Since the backup process doesn't need any network access and should be isolated for security or efficiency, you could use Docker's `None` network mode.

### Example Scenario:

You're working in a **data security** context where you need to ensure that the backup container is completely isolated from other containers and external networks to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or external interference during the backup process.

Here’s how you would set it up:

```bash
docker run --network none -v /path/to/backup:/backup my-backup-container
```

### Breakdown:

* **`--network none`**: This tells Docker to start the container without any network access, meaning it won't have an IP address or be able to communicate with the outside world or any other containers.
* **`-v /path/to/backup:/backup`**: This mounts a local directory on the host to the container, so the backup data can be saved to the host's file system. The container still has access to its local file system but no network connectivity.

Great question — you're absolutely right to challenge that.

If the container is using Docker's `None` network mode, it **cannot** access a remote database over the network — not over TCP/IP, not even on localhost — because it literally has **no network interface at all**.

So, to clarify:

### ✅ What *is* possible in `--network none` mode:

* The container **can access files on the host machine**, if they are **mounted as volumes**.
* It can run processes that operate **purely on local filesystem data** — no networking involved.

### ❌ What is *not* possible:

* It **cannot connect to a database server**, whether local (on host) or remote, because that would require networking.
* Even `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or hostnames won't resolve — the container has no interface to do so.

### Updated Real-World Example (Corrected):

Let’s say you're **processing a database dump file** (e.g., a `.sql` or `.bak` file) that’s already been created and stored locally. Your container’s job is just to:

* Compress it,
* Encrypt it,
* Or copy it to an archive directory.

You do **not** need network access because you're dealing with a **file**, not connecting to a database server.

```bash
docker run --network none -v /backups:/data my-processing-container process /data/db-dump.sql
```

Here:

* `--network none` ensures the container can’t communicate with anything.
* `-v /backups:/data` gives it access to the file system where the database dump is stored.
* Your container just processes that file in-place — no need to connect to a database server.

### So to be 100% clear:

> If you're trying to **connect to a live database**, `--network none` will not work.
> But if you're processing **an already-exported database file**, it's a perfect fit for secure, isolated operations.

### 4. `overlay`

### What is an **Overlay Network** in Docker?

An **Overlay network** is a type of network in Docker that spans across multiple Docker hosts (machines). It allows containers running on different hosts to communicate with each other as if they were on the same local network, even though they may be physically located on separate machines.

### Key Points about Overlay Networks:

* **Distributed Network**: It connects multiple Docker hosts together, enabling containers to communicate across different machines.
* **No OS-level Routing Required**: You don’t need to manually configure routing at the operating system level. Docker handles it for you.
* **Docker Swarm Support**: Overlay networks are primarily used in Docker Swarm clusters, where they enable communication between containers across different nodes in the swarm.
* **Multi-Host Communication**: Even outside of Swarm, you can use overlay networks for multi-host communication between containers on different machines.
* **Scaling and High Availability**: Overlay networks help in building applications that can scale out across multiple machines, while also providing high availability for services.

### How Does It Work?

* **Communication Across Hosts**: Containers connected to the same overlay network on different Docker hosts can send and receive traffic as if they were on the same local network.

* **Encapsulation**: Docker creates virtual networks on top of the physical network and encapsulates the traffic between containers in a secure way, using technologies like VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN).

* **No Direct OS Routing**: The overlay network abstracts the complexity of routing between Docker hosts. It automatically handles the communication, so you don’t have to configure routing rules on the underlying OS.

### Real-World Use Cases

1. **Docker Swarm**: In Docker Swarm, overlay networks are used to allow containers on different Swarm nodes to communicate. For example, a service running on one node (host) can communicate with a service on another node using the same overlay network.

2. **Multi-Host Application Deployment**: If you're deploying a microservices application across multiple physical servers, an overlay network can allow the different microservices (running as containers) to interact seamlessly, no matter where they're deployed.

3. **Scaling Applications**: Overlay networks allow you to easily scale your application across multiple machines while ensuring that all your containers can talk to each other. This is useful in production environments where workloads need to be distributed across multiple machines to meet demand.

4. **High Availability**: In a high-availability setup, overlay networks allow you to deploy replicated services across different Docker hosts. Even if one host goes down, the services on other hosts can continue to work, ensuring continuous service.

### Example

If you have multiple machines running Docker and you want containers on these machines to communicate with each other, you would create an overlay network. Containers on these different machines can now communicate as if they are on the same network.

For example, you could run:

```bash
docker network create --driver overlay my_overlay_network
```

And then, containers from different hosts that are connected to this network can communicate without any manual network configuration.

### When to Use Overlay Networks?

* **Distributed Systems**: When you need to deploy services that span multiple Docker hosts, like a microservices architecture.
* **Docker Swarm or Kubernetes**: Overlay networks are essential in orchestrated environments like Docker Swarm, where you need communication between nodes in the cluster.
* **Cloud Deployments**: In cloud environments where multiple Docker hosts run across different machines or data centers, overlay networks simplify the connectivity between containers.
* **Service Discovery**: In a multi-host environment, overlay networks allow services running on different hosts to discover and communicate with each other dynamically.

## 🔷 5. MacVlan Network Mode

### 🧠 Concept:

Docker gives the container its **own MAC address** and IP address. It looks like a **completely separate physical device** on the network.

### 📡 Behavior:

* Acts like a real machine connected to the physical switch.
* Appears with a unique MAC and IP.
* No NAT — it talks directly to the network.
* Requires your host's network interface to be in **promiscuous mode**.

### 📦 Real-World Example:

You're running an old license server that only grants access to **specific MAC addresses** — like one of those old-school floating license systems (e.g., MATLAB license servers).

You want your Docker container to appear **exactly** like a separate physical machine with its own MAC, so it passes the licensing check.

### ✅ How to use it:

```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 \
  macvlan_net

docker run --rm --network macvlan_net my-container
```

### 🔐 Use Case Summary:

* Legacy networks with MAC restrictions
* Security appliances
* Network scanning or sniffing
* Containers that must look like real devices

---

## 🔶 6. IPVlan Network Mode

### 🧠 Concept:

Docker gives the container a **unique IP address**, but **shares the host’s MAC address**. It behaves like a separate device **only at the IP level**, not MAC level.

### 📡 Behavior:

* All containers use the **same MAC** (host's MAC).
* Each gets a **separate IP**.
* Doesn’t require promiscuous mode — more data center-friendly.

### 📦 Real-World Example:

You're in a **corporate data center** where the switch port **limits the number of MAC addresses** per interface (common in virtualized environments).

Using MacVlan would get blocked. But with IPVlan, you can run multiple containers with different IPs using **only the host’s MAC**, staying within hardware rules.

### ✅ How to use it:

```bash
docker network create -d ipvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 \
  ipvlan_net

docker run --rm --network ipvlan_net my-container
```

### 🔐 Use Case Summary:

* Data centers or networks that restrict MAC addresses
* High-performance environments without NAT
* Containers needing direct IP-level access, but same physical identity

## ❓ Which Network Type Should I Use?

| Use Case                           | Recommended Network |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Most common, simple scenarios      | `bridge`            |
| Accessing host network directly    | `host`              |
| Cross-host container communication | `overlay`           |
| Container as physical device       | `macvlan`           |
| Advanced VLAN/IP management        | `ipvlan`            |

Docker also supports **third-party network plugins** like:

* **Kuryr** – integrates with OpenStack Neutron
* **Weave** – focuses on security, service discovery, and fault tolerance

You can also set `--network none` to **disable networking**, improving container isolation for untrusted workloads.

## ⚙️ How Docker Networking Works

Docker uses your host’s network stack to implement its networking system. Here’s how:

* Docker manipulates **iptables** rules to route traffic.
* Every container has its own **network namespace**, isolating it at the kernel level.
* Virtual interfaces on your host allow containers to send/receive traffic.

You don’t need to configure iptables manually — Docker handles it.

## 🆚 Docker Networking vs. VM Networking

| Feature     | Docker                            | VM                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Isolation   | Network namespaces                | Full networking stack    |
| NAT-based?  | Bridge (like NAT)                 | Usually full NAT         |
| Flexibility | Plugins/macvlan for complex cases | More flexible by default |

Docker offers the tools to **replicate advanced topologies**, including macvlan and third-party plugins.

## 🧪 Using Docker Networks

Let’s dive into using Docker’s networking system in practice.

### 🔧 Creating Networks

```bash
docker network create demo-network -d bridge
```

Output:

```
50ed05634f6a3312e56700ef683ca39df44bfc826e2e4da9179c2593c79910f9
```

> You've created a bridge network. Now let’s connect containers.

---

### 🔗 Connecting Containers to Networks

```bash
# Terminal 2
docker run -it --rm --name container1 --network demo-network busybox:latest
```

```bash
# Terminal 3
docker run -it --rm --name container2 busybox:latest
```

Attempt to ping:

```bash
# inside container1
ping container2  # ❌ fails
```

Now, connect container2 to the network:

```bash
docker network connect demo-network container2
```

Try ping again:

```bash
# inside container1
ping container2  # ✅ success
```

---

### 🌐 Using Host Networking

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx --network host nginx:latest
```

Now test from host:

```bash
curl localhost:80  # Should return the NGINX welcome page
```

---

### 🚫 Disabling Networking

```bash
docker run -it --rm --network none busybox:latest
```

Inside the container:

```bash
ping google.com  # ❌ fails
```

---

### 🔄 Removing Containers from Networks

```bash
docker network disconnect demo-network container2
```

---

### 📜 Managing Networks

List:

```bash
docker network ls
```

Delete:

```bash
docker network rm demo-network
```

Prune unused:

```bash
docker network prune
```

---

## 🧱 Using Networks With Docker Compose

Here’s a simple `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    image: php:7.2-apache
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: changeme
```

Launch:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check networks:

```bash
docker network ls
```

Verify connectivity:

```bash
docker compose exec -it app bash
apt update && apt install iputils-ping -y
ping mysql
```

---

### ➕ Adding Extra Networks

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    image: php:7.2-apache
    networks:
      - db
  helper:
    image: custom-image:latest
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: changeme
    networks:
      - db
networks:
  db:
```

This ensures that `app` and `mysql` can talk to each other, but `helper` is isolated.

---

## 📌 Key Points

* Docker networks allow **flexible communication** between containers, hosts, and external services.
* There are **five core drivers**, each designed for specific scenarios.
* Networks use **host kernel features** like namespaces and iptables.
* **Compose automates** network creation and container wiring.
* You can **disable networking** entirely for security-hardened workloads.
